# Short explanation

I will write a manual on how to use this app later, anyway, I did my best to write a lot of comments inside the code to make it easily readable, this code is a very dynamic expenses tracker, which has a settings panel to allow the user to choose some preferences and every thing will work dynamically, no hard coding....the data will be saved in local storage, the user can always make a backup copy of his data by pressing the download button to download his data to his default browser folder and the user can restore the data for an emergency in case losing data or change the browser or even change the machine, the user only needs to put the backup file inside the root folder of his app and then press the upload button in the App setting panel and will get the data back again from the hard disk....the other local storage like currency and starting year will be restarted by default to 2015 and $ if the user lost his local storage but this can be fixed easily according to the user preference again by using the setting panel.....the only thing which I have to care for it is the categories if the user lost them to restore them automatically through the restored data, it just needs three or four lines code to do that, but as they need to push the code right now to the institute then it will be no problem to do this extra small code at the moment, as I have to focus on my back-end class at the moment.....so excuse this small lack inside the last app..thank you.
