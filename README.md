# Short explination :
I will write a manualy how to use this app later, anyway , i did my best to write a lot of comments inside the code to mak it easy readable, this code is very dynamic expenses tracker, which has settings panel to allow the user to choose some perferences and every thing will work dynamicly , no hard coding....the data will be safed in local storge , the user can always make backup copy of his data by press download button to download his data to his default browser folder and the user can restore the data for emergency in case loseing data or change the browser or even change the machin , the user only need  to put the back up file inside the root folder of his app and then press upload button in the App setting panel and wil get the data back again from the harddisk....the other local stoge like currency and starting year will be restart by default to 2015 and $ if the user lost his localstorge but this can be fixed easy according to the user pereference again by using the setting panel.....the only thing which i have to care for it is the catogories if the user lost them to restore them automitacy through the restored data , it just need three or four lines code to do that, but as they need to push the code right now to the instutite then it will be no propbem to do this extra small code in the moment , as I have to foucs on my back-end class in the moment.....so excuse this small lack insid the last app..thank you.
