# Short explination :
I will write a manualy how to use this app later, anyway , i did my best to write a lot of comments inside the code to mak it easy readable, this code is very dynamic expenses tracker, which has settings panel to allow the user to choose some perferences and every thing will work dynamicly , no hard coding at all ....the data wll be safed in local storge , the user can always make backup copy of his data by press download button to download his data to his default browser folder and the user can restore the data for emergency in case loseing data or change te browser or even chinge the machin , the user only need to to put the back up file iside the root folder of his up an dthen press upload button in the ap setting panel and wil get the data back again from the harddisk....the other local stoge like currency and starting year will be restart by default to 2015 and $ if the user lost his localstorge but this can be fixed easy to the user pereference again by using the setting panel.....the only thing which i hav eto care for it is the catogories if the user lost them to restore them automitacy through the restored data , t just need three or four lines code to do that, but as they need to push the code right now to the instutite then it will be no propbem to do this extra small code in the moment , as I am constrate on my back-end class in te moment and i do not like to take my foucsing and attention from the class even for small code writting.....so excuse this small lack insid ethe last app..thank you.
